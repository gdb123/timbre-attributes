# timbre-attributes
A basic timbre attribute calculator (ie a rehash of the McGill timbre toolbox with a GUI)

This repo would have had a very rich contribution history if I'd joined Github in, say, February instead of August. It contains my final project from Zhiyao Duan's ECE/AME 472/272 "Audio Signal Processing" course in Spring 2018, which was a timbre attribute calculator.

To use, open Matlab in a checked-out directory, and type `run c_gui`. The gui should be mostly self-explanatory.

For more details, see the [paper](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/teaching/ece472/projects/2018/Noah_Kahrs_FinalReport.pdf) or [poster](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/teaching/ece472/projects/2018/Noah_Kahrs_Poster.pdf) for the course. For more context, know that this tool was used for some music theory research I've presented; you can see my brief [Music Theory Midwest Abstract](https://mtmw.org/index.php/conferences/abstracts?id=828) or my longer abstract on pages 154--155 of the [Timbre 2018 Proceedings](https://www.mcgill.ca/timbre2018/files/timbre2018/timbre2018_proceedings.pdf).

Good sources for basic timbre definitions:

Farbood/Price: usual spectral centroid etc. Interesting inharmonicity but that might require pitch tracking that I don't have. Roughness cites Sethares, I shoudld look at that too.

MacCallum/Einbond: has a nice "roughness," but I should probe its genesis further

Peeter/Giordano/et al: Timbre toolbox! Again outlines stuff, useful enough.

Pressnitzer/McAdams cites Bradley-Terry-Luce, from David 1988? not too useful
